### **Briefly About Myself:**
*From 2015 to 2020 I worked in the service sector, longest as a barista in a private company. At the same time, I drew illustrations, and in the summer of 2020, after the strike broke out during the Belarusian rallies, I quit my main job and went freelance.* 

*In 2021, I worked for a few months in a small company, copying and reselling mobile games.*

*Now I'm still doing illustration, but I want to move into the IT field because I don't feel I can compete with the emerging neural networks, which are getting better at generating images.*
